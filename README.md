# Getting started with FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn, while also being powerful and flexible. It is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, which are both well-established libraries in the Python ecosystem.
